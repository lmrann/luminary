            In the present web development ecosystem,
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">JavaScript frameworks</a> are
            something being used by almost every
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">web developer</a> to make their
            development process easier and more productive. But as the
            technology we use keeps improving, the frameworks also keep
            evolving, with better, simpler, and sometimes even more complex
            frameworks being released.
          </p>

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            With this many choices, it can become really difficult to choose the
            best framework to suit your needs
          </p>

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            In this article, we will be talking about two of the biggest
            JavaScript frameworks as of today:
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">Svelte</a> vs
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">React</a>. We’ll compare them
            head-on and list out the pros and cons of each framework to help you
            choose one of them.

        <h2 class="heading-secondary">What Is Svelte?</h2>

        <div class="second-para">
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Svelte is a framework for building fast, flexible, and
            cybernetically enhanced web applications. It’s also known as the
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#"
              >“most loved JavaScript framework”</a
            >
            with the
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">“most satisfied developers”</a>,
            boasting more than 60,000 stars on the
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">GitHub repository</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Svelte applications and components are defined in
            <span class="text-highlight">.svelte</span> files, which are HTML
            files extended with templating syntax that’s similar to JSX.

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary">History</h3>
        <div class="third-para">
          <p class="article__paragraph">
            Svelte originated from
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">Ractive.js</a>, which was
            developed by the creator of Svelte itself: Rich Harris. Svelte was
            designed to succeed Ractive. The first version of Svelte released in
            2016 was basically Ractive, but with a compiler.
          </p>

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            The name “Svelte” was chosen by Rich Harris and his coworkers at The
            Guardian. As time passed, more and more developers came to know
            about and grew interested in Svelte. By 2019, Svelte had become a
            full-fledged tool to build web apps with
            <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">TypeScript</a> support out of the
            box.
          </p>

          <p class="article__paragraph">
            The <a class="paragraph-link" href="#">SvelteKit</a> web framework
            was announced in 2020 and entered beta in 2021.
